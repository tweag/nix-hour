# The Nix Hour

The Nix Hour is a weekly beginner-oriented improvide Q&A-style lecture on Nix, hosted by @infinisil from [Tweag](https://www.tweag.io/). In these sessions you can bring your questions and we'll answer them with more context, examples, alternatives, tradeoffs and related topics.

The sessions currently happen every Thursday at [18:00 CEST](https://time.is/1800_in_CEST) in [this Jitsi Meet](https://meet.zrh.init7.net/nix-hour). For future updates, the event is also tracked in [the NixOS calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=b9o52fobqjak8oq8lfkhg3t0qg@group.calendar.google.com). The sessions are live-streamed to the [Tweag YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@tweag) and collected in [this YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyzwHTVJlRc8yjlx4VR4LU5A5O44og9in).

This issue tracker of this repository is used to track questions for the Nix hour. If you have a question related to Nix, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/tweag/nix-hour/issues/new/choose) and we can take a look at it in the next session. If you see an issue you're also interested in, leave a :+1: on it so we can prioritize it accordingly.

A [time-stamped index](https://github.com/tweag/nix-hour/blob/master/EPISODES.md) of all episodes and their topics is available.
