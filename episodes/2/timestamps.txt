00:00 Intro
00:26 Question: How to override the source of a package
01:47 Difference between .override and .overrideAttrs
04:26 Updating derivation attributes
06:02 "or" operator precedence confusion
06:38 Back to overriding the source
07:18 Replacing "rec"s in mkDerivation with a function
10:15 Overriding the hash of a source
11:56 Demonstrating mkDerivation with a function
13:03 Trying to override the hash of a fetcher derivation directly
15:32 Nulling the hash to force a refetch
16:46 Trying to figure out why overriding the hash didn't work
18:51 Figuring it out: "sha256" is not a derivation attribute
20:45 We can't use override either
21:59 Overriding "outputHash" using "overrideAttrs"
22:47 Clarification about difference between similar problems
24:51 How overriding sha256 with overrideAttrs could work more nicely
26:58 Conclusion about source overriding
28:50 SRI hashes and the "hash" fetcher argument
31:09 "flat" file hashes
34:04 "recursive" NAR hashes
39:38 Conclusion "flat" vs "recursive" hashing
40:43 Why fetchFromGitHub uses "recursive" hashing
43:14 What changes is the NAR archive format sensitive to?
45:42 Sharing derivations using nix-store --export and --import and some other useful flags
52:40 Deleting store paths, nix-store --roots and garbage collection
54:41 Outro
