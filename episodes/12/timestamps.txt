00:00 Intro
01:13 Purity of Nix overview
02:16 Nix language evaluation purity
04:36 Demonstrating evaluation impurities
06:58 Repository is the flake evaluation input
11:43 CLI is the --pure-eval input
15:13 Derivation building purity
18:28 Demonstrating building impurities
21:12 Hacky way of forcing rebuilds every time
24:11 Testing the sandbox and disabling it
29:05 Only disabling the sandbox for specific derivations
30:47 Build randomness
31:59 Why building is not fully pure even with the sandbox
34:34 Relation to reproducibility
40:24 Relation to content-addressed derivations
41:36 Build result runtime purity
47:27 Nix code to improve runtime purity
52:51 Runtime purity comes from Nix code, not Nix itself
53:46 Purity level conclusion
