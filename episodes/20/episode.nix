    The Nix Hour is a weekly beginner-oriented improvised Q&A-style lecture on Nix, where you can bring your questions and we'll answer them with more context, examples, alternatives, tradeoffs and related topics.
    
    Feel free to ask questions using the live chat, or even ask questions directly by joining the meeting: https://meet.jit.si/nix-hour. Alternatively ask questions ahead of time by opening an issue in https://github.com/tweag/nix-hour
